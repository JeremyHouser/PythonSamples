Thick ooze fills an area of the ground you choose within range. The area by default is a 50-foot square, but its dimensions may be whatever you wish, provided it is one continuous pool and the total surface area does not exceed 2500 square feet. The resulting pool has a depth of 10 feet and is difficult terrain. The area looks like a shallow pool of water at first glance, and any creature that was not aware of the spell being cast must make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell DC to believe otherwise before contact is made with the pool.
   A creature entering the pool for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 acid damage on a failed save and sinking into the pool, as the grappled condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much acid damage and is not grappled. A grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A creature of size Large or smaller that fails the saving throw while already grappled by the pool is also restrained against your spell save DC.
   A restrained creature can't breathe, and any nonmagical metal objects it carries begin to corrode. When the restrained creature takes acid damage from the pool, non-magical metal weapons and armor take a permanent, cumulative -1 penalty to their damage rolls and AC, respectively. If this penalty on a weapon reaches -5, the weapon is destroyed; similarly, armor is destroyed if its AC is reduced to 10. Other metal objects take cumulative damage as well, as the pool eats through a 1-inchthickness of non-magical metal each round it is immersed.

   Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of a vampire, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of a vampire. If the vampire has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours, use the vampire’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form. As a vampire, you do not age.
   You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.
   You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them, provided that your vampiric form is physically capable of doing so. You can speak all of the languages you knew before the transformation.
   When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the ground or is worn by your new form. Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the vampire’s shape and size compared to those of your original form. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must fall to the ground. During this spell’s duration, you cannot end the spell prematurely.

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Classes: Druid
You call forth an shambling mound created from any vegetation around you. Choose an unoccupied area near a source of vegetation that you can see within range. A shambling mound will rise from the ground in this location. The mound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points. The mound is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the mound, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the mound, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken before the spell’s duration is reached, you lose control of the mound and it becomes hostile toward you and your companions. A hostile shambling mound can’t be dismissed by you. It disappears when its hit points reach 0 or 1 hour after you summoned it, whichever happens first. The DM has the creature’s game statistics.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you summon two shambling mounds in unoccupied area that you can see.

The wyrmling is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the wyrmling, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don’t violate its alignment. If you don’t issue any commands to the wyrmling, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. The DM has the wyrmling's statistics.

Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (holy symbol of Kelemvor)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a beam of radiant energy that burns undead creatures in a 20-foot radius cylinder up to 100 feet tall centered on a point that you can see within range. The cylinder is considered difficult terrain for undead creatures. When an undead creature enters the cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the undead creature takes 6d10 radiant damage or half as much on a success. Incorporeal undead automatically fail the save and take maximum damage from the spell. Living creatures are unaffected by the cylinder and it is not difficult terrain for them.

If you're within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 30 feet as a bonus action.

Uncontrolled warriors can't be dismissed by you and disappear 1 hour after they are summoned. The DM has the warriors' statistics.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the number of auxiliary warriors you may summon increases to 2d6+6.

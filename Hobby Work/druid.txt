The beast is considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creature is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, it will defend itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures’ game statistics (stats as a Mammoth but gains 30 ft. fly speed).
   Up to 5 creatures of medium size or smaller can mount the beetle at a time, but it only responds to commands given by you.

Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Classes: Druid
You call forth an shambling mound created from any vegetation around you. Choose an unoccupied area near a source of vegetation that you can see within range. A shambling mound will rise from the ground in this location. The mound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points. The mound is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the mound, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the mound, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken before the spell’s duration is reached, you lose control of the mound and it becomes hostile toward you and your companions. A hostile shambling mound can’t be dismissed by you. It disappears when its hit points reach 0 or 1 hour after you summoned it, whichever happens first. The DM has the creature’s game statistics.
   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you summon two shambling mounds in unoccupied area that you can see.

8th level:::
﻿Alluvial Pool
8th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a vial of ooze)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Classes: Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
Thick ooze fills an area of the ground you choose within range. The area by default is a 50-foot square, but its dimensions may be whatever you wish, provided it is one continuous pool and the total surface area does not exceed 2500 square feet. The resulting pool has a depth of 10 feet and is difficult terrain. The area looks like a shallow pool of water at first glance, and any creature that was not aware of the spell being cast must make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell DC to believe otherwise before contact is made with the pool.
   A creature entering the pool for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 acid damage on a failed save and sinking into the pool, as the grappled condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much acid damage and is not grappled. A grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A creature of size Large or smaller that fails the saving throw while already grappled by the pool is also restrained against your spell save DC.
   A restrained creature can't breathe, and any nonmagical metal objects it carries begin to corrode. When the restrained creature takes acid damage from the pool, non-magical metal weapons and armor take a permanent, cumulative -1 penalty to their damage rolls and AC, respectively. If this penalty on a weapon reaches -5, the weapon is destroyed; similarly, armor is destroyed if its AC is reduced to 10. Other metal objects take cumulative damage as well, as the pool eats through a 1-inchthickness of non-magical metal each round it is immersed.

Armor of Irritants
8th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Up to 24 hours
Classes: Druid
One hundred tiny insects cover your body and grant you 100 temporary hit points. Also, you are immune to poisons and diseases for the duration. You gain additional effects depending on how many temporary hit points are remaining:
   • 75 or more. You have three-quarters cover.
   • 45 or more. You have half cover.
   Additionally, once per round, if a single source of damage would remove more than 50 temporary hit points, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the next attack against you. The spell lasts for the duration or when the temporary hit points are depleted, whichever happens first.

9th level:::
Tamara’s Rebirth
9th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth at least 10,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Up to 24 hours
Classes: Bard, Cleric, Druid
You touch a willing creature that has 1 or more hit points, infusing it with a blessing from Tamara, dragon goddess of life, light and mercy. If the target dies during the duration, for any reason except old age, the blessing is triggered. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life at the start of its next turn with hit points equal to half its hit point maximum. As a bonus action on the same turn, the target can expend as many of its hit dice as it chooses to heal itself. Roll each die spent, adding your Constitution modifier to each, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total.
   This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.
   The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists. The target then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of where it died.

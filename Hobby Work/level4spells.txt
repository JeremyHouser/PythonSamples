Army of the Dead
4th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 45 feet
Components: V, S, M (a handful of bone dust)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Classes: Cleric, Warlock, Wizard
This spell creates 2d4 undead servant skeletons. Choose piles of humanoid bones within range. Your spell imbues the targets with a foul mimicry of life, raising them as undead skeletons (the DM has the creature's game statistics). The skeletons act immediately after your turn on the initiative order.
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creatures you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creatures only defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creatures continue to follow it until their task is complete.
The creatures are under your control for 1 minute, after which point the spell ends and they collapse to the ground, lifeless.
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you are able to add an addition 1d4 to the total number of skeletons raised by this spell for every slot higher than 4th level.

The spell’s magic ends on the piece of ammunition when it hits or misses, and the spell ends when twelve pieces of ammunition have been drawn from the quiver.
If a target dies as a result of your ranged attack while using this ammunition, its flesh melts away and it is raised as a skeleton under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. You may control a number of skeletons equal to your proficiency bonus at any time with this spell.
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command a skeleton raised by a dusk arrow if it is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).

• Hinder: The embers work to oppress your foes. All creatures that you choose within range must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage and have their movement speed halved until the end of their next turn.

It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 10 feet of you. You can send the weapon rack back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the rack and the replica.
After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell’s effect ends.

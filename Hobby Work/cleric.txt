Kelemvor’s Irradiating Beam
7th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (holy symbol of Kelemvor)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Classes: Cleric, Wizard
You create a beam of radiant energy that burns undead creatures in a 20-foot radius cylinder up to 100 feet tall centered on a point that you can see within range. The cylinder is considered difficult terrain for undead creatures. When an undead creature enters the cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the undead creature takes 6d10 radiant damage or half as much on a success. Incorporeal undead automatically fail the save and take maximum damage from the spell. Living creatures are unaffected by the cylinder and it is not difficult terrain for them.
   Additionally, the cylinder sheds bright light for 60 feet from its center and dim light for another 20 feet.
   If you're within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 30 feet as a bonus action.
   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 7th.

Reveille
7th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a war horn)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Classes: Bard, Cleric, Wizard
You summon warriors to fight for you and your allies with a blast through a war horn that calls them to arms. Choose between a Knight or a Veteran; the chosen creature appears within range, as well as a squad of auxiliary warriors composed of 2d4+4 Guards or Bandits, respectively.
   The summoned warriors are friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the warriors, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the warriors, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions.
   If your concentration is broken, the warriors don't disappear. Instead, you lose command of them, and they become neutral to you and your companions, following the command of the Knight or Veteran (as appropriate). Uncontrolled warriors can't be dismissed by you and disappear 1 hour after they are summoned. The DM has the warriors' statistics.
   At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level, the number of auxiliary warriors you may summon increases to 2d6+6. When you cast it using a spell slot of 9th level, this number increases to 2d8+8, or you may summon 12 auxiliary warriors and an additional Knight or Veteran, which must be of the same type as the initial choice.

8th level:::
Scornful Mantle of the Undaunted
8th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a ruby worth 1,000 gp)
Duration: Up to 1 minute
Classes: Bard, Cleric
You touch a willing creature and strengthen its resolve, allowing it to become dauntless in the face of untold danger. For the duration, the target becomes immune to all condition effects. If the target is currently affected with any condition other than unconscious or exhaustion, casting this spell will remove those conditions from the target. Additionally, if a single source of damage would kill the target, the target health is set to 1 hit point instead, and the spell ends.

9th level:::
Tamara’s Rebirth
9th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth at least 10,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Up to 24 hours
Classes: Bard, Cleric, Druid
You touch a willing creature that has 1 or more hit points, infusing it with a blessing from Tamara, dragon goddess of life, light and mercy. If the target dies during the duration, for any reason except old age, the blessing is triggered. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to life at the start of its next turn with hit points equal to half its hit point maximum. As a bonus action on the same turn, the target can expend as many of its hit dice as it chooses to heal itself. Roll each die spent, adding your Constitution modifier to each, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total.
   This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.
   The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists. The target then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of where it died.
